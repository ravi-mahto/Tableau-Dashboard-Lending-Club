### Following are the insights we can see from the dashboard:
* As the loan amount increases, the chances of an applicant might turn out to a defaulter is high
* Higher the interest rate, possibility of applicant to become a default is high
* Lower the annual income, higher the chances of defaulters
* Higher the debt to income ratio, there are the chances that applicants might turn out to a defaulter is high
* As the balance to credit limit ratio increases, possibility of applicant to become a default is high
* More the recent inquiries, more the chance of defaulting.
* More the number of taxes missed, higher the possibility of loan default
* Higher the employment length of the applicant, lower the possibility of being default.
* Higher the term, more the chance of defaulting.
